Materials for the introductory reinforcement learning course *A Glance at Reinforcement Learning*.  If you like this, Make sure you check out [rl-resources](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/rl-resources), which contains all the literature used in the course and tips on where to go next.

This project is built and maintained by Adam Green - [adam.green@adgefficiency.com](adam.green@adgefficiency.com).

The course is built using `reveal.js`.  [A pdf of the slides is included](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/rl-course/blob/master/slides.pdf), or you can locally deploy the presentation using:

```bash
brew install node 

npm install

npm start
```

## Content

- background statistical concepts
- Markov Decision processes
- value function methods (DQN and it's extensions)
- policy gradient methods
- AlphaGo to AlphaZero
- practical advice for experiments
- current state of the art

## Goals for the course

Introduction to **concepts, ideas and terminology**.  Familiarity with important literature.  Understanding of the state of the field today.  Practical strategies to run reinforcement learning experiments.

## Where to go next
