Materials for the introductory reinforcement learning course *A Glance at Reinforcement Learning*.  I also maintain a curated collection of reinforcement learning resources in the [rl-resources repo](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/rl-resources).

This project is built and maintained by Adam Green - [adam.green@adgefficiency.com](adam.green@adgefficiency.com).

## Setup

```bash
brew install node 

npm install

npm start
```

## Content

- background statistical concepts
- Markov Decision processes
- value function methods (DQN and it's extensions)
- policy gradient methods
- AlphaGo to AlphaZero
- practical advice for experiments
- current state of the art

## Goals for the course

Introduction to **concepts, ideas and terminology**.  Familiarity with important literature.  Understanding of the state of the field today.  Practical strategies to run reinforcement learning experiments.

## Where to go next

- The Holy Book of reinforcement learning - [Sutton & Barto - Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction - 2nd Edition](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf)
- UCL Lectures - David Silver (Head of Reinforcement Learning at DeepMind) - [slides](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr_rl/tree/master/literature/silver_lectures) - [lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0)

Further resources (video lectures, blog posts etc) are listed in [dsr-rl/resources.md](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/dsr-rl/blob/master/readme.md).
